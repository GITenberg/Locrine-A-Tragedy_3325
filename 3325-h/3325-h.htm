v</span><i>DEDICATION</i></h2>
<p style="text-align: center">TO ALICE SWINBURNE.</p>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> love that comes
and goes like wind or fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath words and wings wherewith to speak and flee.<br
/>
But love more deep than passion&rsquo;s deep desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clear and inviolable as the unsounded sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What wings of words may serve to set it free,<br />
To lift and lead it homeward?&nbsp; Time and death<br />
Are less than love: or man&rsquo;s live spirit saith<br />
False, when he deems his life is more than breath.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p class="poetry">No words may utter love; no sovereign song<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak all it would for love&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Yet
would I<br />
Fain cast in moulded rhymes that do me wrong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some little part of all my love: but why<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should weak and wingless words be fain to fly?<br />
For us the years that live not are not dead:<br />
Past days and present in our hearts are wed:<br />
My song can say no more than love hath said.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Love needs nor song nor speech to say what
love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would speak or sing, were speech and song not
weak<br />
To bear the sense-belated soul above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bid the lips of silence breathe and speak.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor power nor will has love to find or seek<br />
Words indiscoverable, ampler strains of song<br />
Than ever hailed him fair or shewed him strong:<br />
And less than these should do him worse than wrong.</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p class="poetry">We who remember not a day wherein<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have not loved each other,&mdash;who can see<br
/>
No time, since time bade first our days begin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the sweep of memory&rsquo;s wings, when we<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have known not what each other&rsquo;s love must
be,&mdash;<br />
We are well content to know it, and rest on this,<br />
And call not words to witness that it is.<br />
To love aloud is oft to love amiss.</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p class="poetry">But if the gracious witness borne of words<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take not from speechless love the secret grace<br />
That binds it round with silence, and engirds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its heart with memories fair as heaven&rsquo;s own
face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let love take courage for a little space<br />
To speak and be rebuked not of the soul,<br />
Whose utterance, ere the unwitting speech be whole,<br />
Rebukes itself, and craves again control.</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p class="poetry">A ninefold garland wrought of song-flowers
nine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wound each with each in chance-inwoven accord<br />
Here at your feet I lay as on a shrine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereof the holiest love that lives is lord.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With faint strange hues their leaves are freaked and
scored:<br />
The fable-flowering land wherein they grew<br />
Hath dreams for stars, and grey romance for dew:<br />
Perchance no flower thence plucked may flower anew.</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">No part have these wan legends in the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose glory lightens Greece and gleams on Rome.<br
/>
Their elders live: but these&mdash;their day is done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their records written of the wind in foam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fly down the wind, and darkness takes them home.<br
/>
What Homer saw, what Virgil dreamed, was truth,<br />
And dies not, being divine: but whence, in sooth,<br />
Might shades that never lived win deathless youth?</p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">The fields of fable, by the feet of faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Untrodden, bloom not where such deep mist drives.<br
/>
Dead fancy&rsquo;s ghost, not living fancy&rsquo;s wraith,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is now the storied sorrow that survives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith in the record of these lifeless lives.<br />
Yet Milton&rsquo;s sacred feet have lingered there,<br />
His lips have made august the fabulous air,<br />
His hands have touched and left the wild weeds fair.</p>
<h3>IX.</h3>
<p class="poetry">So, in some void and thought-untrammelled
hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let these find grace, my sister, in your sight,<br
/>
Whose glance but cast on casual things hath power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To do the sun&rsquo;s work, bidding all be bright<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With comfort given of love: for love is light.<br />
Were all the world of song made mine to give,<br />
The best were yours of all its flowers that live:<br />
Though least of all be this my gift, forgive.</p>

<p class="poetry">Child, hast thou looked upon thy grandsire
dead?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ay.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thou sawest our
Britain&rsquo;s heart and head<br />
Death-stricken.&nbsp; Seemed not there my sire to thee<br />
More great than thine, or all men living?&nbsp; We<br />
Stand shadows of the fathers we survive:<br />
Earth bears no more nor sees such births alive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Why, he was great of thews&mdash;and wise, thou
say&rsquo;st:<br />
Yet seems my sire to me the fairer-faced&mdash;<br />
The kinglier and the kindlier.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Yea, his eyes<br />
Are liker seas that feel the summering skies<br />
In concord of sweet colour&mdash;and his brow<br />
Shines gentler than my father&rsquo;s ever: thou,<br />
So seeing, dost well to hold thy sire so dear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I said not that his love sat yet so near<br />
My heart as thine doth: rather am I thine,<br />
Thou knowest, than his.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Nay&mdash;rather seems Locrine<br />
Thy sire than I thy mother.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Wherefore?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Boy,<br />
Because of all our sires who fought for Troy<br />
Most like thy father and my lord Locrine,<br />
I think, was Paris.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">How may man divine<br />
Thy meaning?&nbsp; Blunt am I, thou knowest, of wit;<br />
And scarce yet man&mdash;men tell me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ask not it.<br />
I meant not thou shouldst understand&mdash;I spake<br />
As one that sighs, to ease her heart of ache,<br />
And would not clothe in words her cause for sighs&mdash;<br />
Her naked cause of sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Wert thou wise,<br />
Mother, thy tongue had chosen of two things one&mdash;<br />
Silence, or speech.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Speech had I chosen, my son,<br />
I had wronged thee&mdash;yea, perchance I have wronged thine
ears<br />
Too far, to say so much.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, these are tears<br />
That gather toward thine eyelids now.&nbsp; Thou hast broken<br
/>
Silence&mdash;if now thy speech die down unspoken,<br />
Thou dost me wrong indeed&mdash;but more than mine<br />
The wrong thou dost thyself is.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And Locrine&mdash;<br />
Were not thy sire wronged likewise of me?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Yea.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Yet&mdash;I may choose yet&mdash;nothing will I
say<br />
More.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Choose, and have thy choice; it galls not
me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Son, son! thy speech is bitterer than the
sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Yet, were the gulfs of hell not bitterer,
thine<br />
Might match thy son&rsquo;s, who hast called my
sire&mdash;Locrine&mdash;<br />
Thy lord, and lord of all this land&mdash;the king<br />
Whose name is bright and sweet as earth in spring,<br />
Whose love is mixed with Britain&rsquo;s very life<br />
As heaven with earth at sunrise&mdash;thou, his wife,<br />
Hast called him&mdash;and the poison of the word<br />
Set not thy tongue on fire&mdash;I lived and heard&mdash;<br />
Coward.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thou liest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">If then thy speech rang true,<br />
Why, now it rings not false.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thou art treacherous too&mdash;<br />
His heart, thy father&rsquo;s very heart is thine&mdash;<br />
O, well beseems it, meet it is, Locrine,<br />
That liar and traitor and changeling he should be<br />
Who, though I bare him, was begot by thee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">How have I lied, mother?&nbsp; Was this the
lie,<br />
That thou didst call my father coward, and I<br />
Heard?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Nay&mdash;I did but liken him with one<br />
Not all unlike him; thou, my child, his son,<br />
Art more unlike thy father.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Was not then,<br />
Of all our fathers, all recorded men,<br />
The man whose name, thou sayest, is like his name&mdash;<br />
Paris&mdash;a sign in all men&rsquo;s mouths of shame?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, save when heaven would cross him in the
fight,<br />
He bare him, say the minstrels, as a knight&mdash;<br />
Yea, like thy father.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Shame then were it none<br />
Though men should liken me to him?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">My son,<br />
I had rather see thee&mdash;see thy brave bright head,<br />
Strong limbs, clear eyes&mdash;drop here before me dead.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">If he were true man, wherefore?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">False was he;<br />
No coward indeed, but faithless, trothless&mdash;we<br />
Hold therefore, as thou sayest, his princely name<br />
Unprincely&mdash;dead in honour&mdash;quick in shame.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And his to mine thou likenest?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thine? to thine?<br />
God rather strike thy life as dark as mine<br />
Than tarnish thus thine honour!&nbsp; For to me<br />
Shameful it seems&mdash;I know not if it be&mdash;<br />
For men to lie, and smile, and swear, and lie,<br />
And bear the gods of heaven false witness.&nbsp; I<br />
Can hold not this but shameful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thou dost well.<br />
I had liefer cast my soul alive to hell<br />
Than play a false man false.&nbsp; But were he true<br />
And I the traitor&mdash;then what heaven should do<br />
I wot not, but myself, being once awake<br />
Out of that treasonous trance, were fain to slake<br />
With all my blood the fire of shame wherein<br />
My soul should burn me living in my sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thy soul?&nbsp; Yea, there&mdash;how knowest
thou, boy, so well?&mdash;<br />
The fire is lit that feeds the fires of hell.<br />
Mine is aflame this long time now&mdash;but thine&mdash;<br />
O, how shall God forgive thee this, Locrine,<br />
That thou, for shame of these thy treasons done,<br />
Hast rent the soul in sunder of thy son?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">My heart is whole yet, though thy speech be
fire<br />
Whose flame lays hold upon it.&nbsp; Hath my sire<br />
Wronged thee?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, child, I lied&mdash;I did but
rave&mdash;<br />
I jested&mdash;was my face, then, sad and grave,<br />
When most I jested with thee?&nbsp; Child, my brain<br />
Is wearied, and my heart worn down with pain:<br />
I thought awhile, for very sorrow&rsquo;s sake,<br />
To play with sorrow&mdash;try thy spirit, and take<br />
Comfort&mdash;God knows I know not what I said,<br />
My father, whom I loved, being newly dead.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I pray thee that thou jest with me no more<br
/>
Thus.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Dost thou now believe me?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">No.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I bore<br />
A brave man when I bore thee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I desire<br />
No more of laud or leasing.&nbsp; Hath my sire<br />
Wronged thee?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Never.&nbsp; But wilt thou trust me now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">As trustful am I, mother of mine, as thou.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">The gods be good to thee!&nbsp; How farest
thou?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well.<br />
Heaven hath no power to hurt me more: and hell<br />
No fire to fear.&nbsp; The world I dwelt in died<br />
With my dead father.&nbsp; King, thy world is wide<br />
Wherein thy soul rejoicingly puts trust:<br />
But mine is strait, and built by death of dust.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">LOCRINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thy sire, mine uncle, stood the sole man,
then,<br />
That held thy life up happy?&nbsp; Guendolen,<br />
Hast thou nor child nor husband&mdash;or are we<br />
Worth no remembrance more at all of thee?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thy speech is sweet; thine eyes are flowers
that shine:<br />
If ever siren bare a son, Locrine,<br />
To reign in some green island and bear sway<br />
On shores more shining than the front of day<br />
And cliffs whose brightness dulls the morning&rsquo;s brow,<br />
That son of sorceries and of seas art thou.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">LOCRINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, now thy tongue it is that plays on men;<br
/>
And yet no siren&rsquo;s honey, Guendolen,<br />
Is this fair speech, though soft as breathes the south,<br />
Which thus I kiss to silence on thy mouth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thy soul is softer than this boy&rsquo;s of
thine:<br />
His heart is all toward battle.&nbsp; Was it mine<br />
That put such fire in his? for none that heard<br />
Thy flatteries&mdash;nay, I take not back the word&mdash;<br />
A flattering lover lives my loving lord&mdash;<br />
Could guess thine hand so great with spear or sword.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">LOCRINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">What have I done for thee to mock with
praise<br />
And make the boy&rsquo;s eyes widen?&nbsp; All my days<br />
Are worth not all a week, if war be all,<br />
Of his that loved no bloodless festival&mdash;<br />
Thy sire, and sire of slaughters: this was one<br />
Who craved no more of comfort from the sun<br />

<p class="poetry">A goodly spoil<br />
Was that thine hand made then by Humber&rsquo;s banks<br />
Of all who swelled the Scythian&rsquo;s riotous ranks<br />
With storm of inland surf and surge of steel:<br />
None there were left, if tongues ring true, to feel<br />
The yoke of days that breathe submissive breath<br />
More bitter than the bitterest edge of death.</p>

<p class="poetry">For shame&rsquo;s own sake the hand that should
not fear<br />
To take such monstrous work upon it here,<br />

A grievous love, a loving grief is mine.<br />
Here stands my husband: there my father lies:<br />
I know not if there live in either&rsquo;s eyes<br />
More love, more life of comfort.&nbsp; This our son<br />
Loves me: but is there else left living one<br />
That loves me back as I love?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

No part have I&mdash;nay, never had I part&mdash;<br />
Our child that hears me knows it&mdash;in thine heart.<br />
Thy sire it was that bade our hands be one<br />
For love of mine, his brother: thou, his son,<br />
Didst give not&mdash;no&mdash;but yield thy hand to mine,<br />
To mine thy lips&mdash;not thee to me, Locrine.<br />
Thy heart has dwelt far off me all these years;<br />
Yet have I never sought with smiles or tears<br />
To lure or melt it meward.&nbsp; I have borne&mdash;<br />
I that have borne to thee this boy&mdash;thy scorn,<br />
Thy gentleness, thy tender words that bite<br />
More deep than shame would, shouldst thou spurn or smite<br />
These limbs and lips made thine by contract&mdash;made<br />
No wife&rsquo;s, no queen&rsquo;s&mdash;a
servant&rsquo;s&mdash;nay, thy shade.<br />
The shadow am I, my lord and king, of thee,<br />
Who art spirit and substance, body and soul to me.<br />
And now,&mdash;nay, speak not&mdash;now my sire is dead<br />
Thou think&rsquo;st to cast me crownless from thy bed<br />
Wherein I brought thee forth a son that now<br />
Shall perish with me, if thou wilt&mdash;and thou<br />
Shalt live and laugh to think of us&mdash;or yet<br />
Play faith more foul&mdash;play falser, and forget.</p>

Thy spirit is soft and sweet: I well believe<br />
Thou wouldst, but well I know thou canst not grieve.<br />
The tears like fire, the fire that burns up tears,<br />
The blind wild woe that seals up eyes and ears,<br />
The sound of raging silence in the brain<br />
That utters things unutterable for pain,<br />
The thirst at heart that cries on death for ease,<br />
What knows thy soul&rsquo;s live sense of pangs like these?</p>

Born and bred up to read the word aright<br />
That sunders man from beast as day from night.<br />
That red rank Ireland where men burn and slay<br />
Girls, old men, children, mothers, sires, and say<br />

So much more vile than vilest men as these.<br />
And though the folk be fierce that harbour there<br />
As once the Scythians driven before thee were,<br />

Wax red and radiant from such fire of fight<br />
And swell as high with blood of hosts in flight&mdash;<br />
No fiercer foe nor worthier shall he meet<br />
Than then fell grovelling at his father&rsquo;s feet.<br />
Nor, though the day run red with blood of men<br />
As that whose hours rang round thy praises then,<br />

Than his that gat him&mdash;and that held it sin<br />
To spill strange blood of barbarous women&mdash;wives<br />
Or harlots&mdash;things of monstrous names and lives&mdash;<br />
Fit spoil for swords of harsher-hearted folk;<br />
Nor yet, though some that dared and &lsquo;scaped the stroke<br

Be fair as beasts are beauteous,&mdash;fit to make<br />
False hearts of fools bow down for love&rsquo;s foul sake,<br />
And burn up faith to ashes&mdash;shall my son<br />
Forsake his father&rsquo;s ways for such an one<br />
As whom thy soldiers slew or slew not&mdash;thou<br />
Hast no remembrance of them left thee now.<br />
Even therefore may we stand assured of this:<br />
What lip soever lure his lip to kiss,<br />
Past question&mdash;else were he nor mine nor thine&mdash;<br />

Black yet no less with poison.</p>

I know the colour of the tongues of fire<br />
That feed on shame to slake the thirst of hate;<br />
Hell-black, and hot as hell: nor age nor state<br />
May pluck the fangs forth of their foul desire:<br />
I that was trothplight servant to thy sire,<br />
A king more kingly than the front of fate<br />
That bade our lives bow down disconsolate<br />
When death laid hold on him&mdash;for hope nor hire,<br />
Prince, would I lie to thee: nay, what avails<br />
Falsehood? thou knowest I would not.</p>

Beyond all record in the world of shame,<br />
If they that hither bore in heart that fire<br />

Lest, if suspicion bring forth strife, and fear<br />
Hatred, its face be withered with a curse;<br />
Lest the eyeless doubt of unseen ill be worse<br />
Than very truth of evil.&nbsp; Thou shalt hear<br />
Such truth as falling in a base man&rsquo;s ear<br />
Should bring forth evil indeed in hearts perverse;<br />
But forth of thine shall truth, once known, disperse<br />
Doubt: and dispersed, the cloud shall leave thee clear<br />
In judgment&mdash;nor, being young, more merciless,<br />
I think, than I toward hearts that erred and yearned,<br />
Struck through with love and blind with fire of life<br />
Enkindled.&nbsp; When the sharp and stormy stress<br />
Of Scythian ravin round our borders burned<br />
Eastward, and he that faced it first in strife,<br />
King Albanact, thy brother, fought and fell,<br />
Locrine our lord, and lordliest born of you,&mdash;<br />
Thy chief, my prince, and mine&mdash;against them drew<br />
With all the force our southern strengths might tell,<br />
And by the strong mid water&rsquo;s seaward swell<br />
That sunders half our Britain met and slew<br />
The prince whose blood baptized its fame anew<br />
And left no record of the name to dwell<br />
Whereby men called it ere it wore his name,<br />
Humber; and wide on wing the carnage went<br />
Along the drenched red fields that felt the tramp<br />
At once of fliers and slayers with feet like flame:<br />
But the king halted, seeing a royal tent<br />
Reared, with its ensign crowning all the camp,<br />
And entered&mdash;where no Scythian spoil he found,<br />
But one fair face, the Scythian&rsquo;s sometime prey,<br />
A lady&rsquo;s whom their ships had borne away<br />
By force of warlike hand from German ground,<br />
A bride and queen by violent power fast bound<br />
To the errant helmsman of their fierce array.<br />
And her, left lordless by that ended fray,<br />
Our lord beholding loved, and hailed, and crowned<br />
Queen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Nay, my lord<br />
Knows that albeit their hands were precontract<br />
By Brute your father dying, no man of men<br />
May fasten hearts with hands in one accord.<br />
The love our master knew not that he lacked<br />
Fulfilled him even as heaven by dawn is filled<br />
With fire and light that burns and blinds and leads<br />
All men to wise or witless works or deeds,<br />
Beholding, ere indeed he wist or willed,<br />
Eyes that sent flame through veins that age had chilled.</p>

The sun&rsquo;s own fire must once have kindled,&mdash;thou<br />
Sing praise of soft-lipped women? doth not shame<br />
Sting thee, to sound this minstrel&rsquo;s note, and gild<br />
A girl&rsquo;s proud face with praises, though her brow<br />
Were bright as dawn&rsquo;s?&nbsp; And had her grace no name<br

Though less in years than his&mdash;such hap was ours<br />
When chance drew forth for us the lots that were<br />

Scarce worth a smile of his&mdash;thy lord

Down ways that I know not, I,<br />

Mid March would have seen me die,<br />

In March before its life were well on wing,<br />
Before its time and kindly season&mdash;why<br />
Should spring be sad&mdash;before the swallows fly&mdash;<br />
Enough to dream of such a wintry thing?<br />
Such foolish words were more unmeet for spring<br />

Aloud, and lower and softlier to the sand:<br />
The flower-fays, lip to lip and hand in hand,<br />
Laugh and repeat it all till darkness hushes<br />
Their singing with a word that falls and crushes<br />
All song to silence down the river-strand<br />
And where the hawthorns hearken for the thrushes.<br />
And all the secret sense is sweet and wise<br />
That sings through all their singing, and replies<br />
When we would know if heaven be gay or grey<br />
And would not open all too soon our eyes<br />
To look perchance on no such happy skies&mdash;<br />
As sleep brings close and waking blows away.</p>

What manner of crown that wreath of towers may be<br />
That makes its proud head shine like older Troy&rsquo;s,<br />

That breathes ill news: but where its fang hath stung<br />

So mocked with strange misprision and misdeemed<br />
Merciless, false, unbrotherly&mdash;to take<br />
Such task upon it as may burn thine heart<br />
With bitterer hatred of me that I spake<br />

Chance haply might have made a fiery sword<br />

Slave of thy tongue and subject of thine hand,<br />
And pity thee.&nbsp; Take, if thou wilt, my head;<br />
Give it my brother.&nbsp; Thou shalt hear me speak<br />
First, though the soothfast word that hangs unsaid<br />
As yet, being spoken,&mdash;albeit this hand be weak<br />

His knaveship&mdash;should he sunder man and wife?<br />
Such, sister, in thy sight, it seems, am I.<br />

And truth?&nbsp; Shame never toward thine heart came near,<br />
And all thy life hath hung about thy name.<br />
Nor ever truth drew nigh the lips that fear<br />
Whitens, and makes the blood that feeds them tame.<br />
Speak all thou wilt&mdash;but even for shame, forsooth,<br />
Talk not of shame&mdash;and tell me not of truth.</p>

Caught ever captive and subdued Locrine:<br />
The god of lies bear witness.&nbsp; At the ford<br />
Of Humber blood was never shed like wine:<br />
Our brother Albanact lived, fought, and died,<br />
Never: and I that swear it have not lied.</p>

<p class="poetry">For pure heart&rsquo;s love? what wage holds
love in fee?<br />
Might half my kingdom serve?&nbsp; Nay, mock not me,<br />
Fair uncle: should I cleave the crown in twain<br />
And gird thy temples with the goodlier half,<br />
Think&rsquo;st thou my debt might so be paid again&mdash;<br />
Thy sceptre made a more imperial staff<br />
Than sways as now thy hill-folk?</p>

<p class="poetry">Dost thou laugh?<br />
Were this too much for kings to give and take?<br />
If warrior Wales do battle for thy sake,<br />
Should I that kept thy crown for thee be held<br />
Worth less than royal guerdon?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Keep thine own,<br />
And let the loud fierce knaves thy brethren quelled<br />
Ward off the wolves whose hides should line thy throne,<br />
Wert thou no coward, no recreant to the bone,<br />
No liar in spirit and soul and heartless heart,<br />
No slave, no traitor&mdash;nought of all thou art.<br />
A thing like thee, made big with braggart breath,<br />
Whose tongue shoots fire, whose promise poisons trust,<br />
Would cast a shieldless soldier forth to death<br />
And wreck three realms to sate his rancorous lust<br />
With ruin of them who have weighed and found him dust.<br />
Get thee to Wales: there strut in speech and swell:<br />
And thence betimes God speed thee safe to hell.</p>

Death?&nbsp; Could I live, and lack thee?&nbsp; Thou, O king,<br

Why shouldst thou swear, and wherefore should I trust?<br />
When day shall drive not night from heaven, and night<br />

Of dawn that shall not slay them.</p>

Not by one hour, like us of longer lives,<br />
The sun she lives in and the love he gives<br />

Death.</p>

The spring has brought, to serve my heart&rsquo;s desire,<br />
Forth of the river&rsquo;s barren bed! no more<br />
Will I rebuke these banks for sterile sloth<br />
When spring restores the woodlands.&nbsp; By my troth,<br />

So large a tribute worth so full a smile.</p>

Less than the flowers that seeing all heaven above<br />

Live no less glad of snowtime than of spring:<br />
It cannot change my father&rsquo;s face for me<br />
Nor turn from mine away my mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; King<br />

No cloud of thought or thunder: were my life<br />
Crowned but as lord and sire of child and wife,<br />
Throned but as prince of woodland, bank and bower,<br />

<p class="poetry">And though thou sworest not, yet the thing
should be.<br />
The burden found for me so sore to bear<br />
Why should I lay on any hand but mine,<br />
Or bid thine own take part therein, and wear<br />
A father&rsquo;s blood upon it&mdash;here&mdash;for sign?<br />
Ay, now thou pluck&rsquo;st it forth of hers to whom<br />
Thou sworest and gavest it plighted.&nbsp; O Locrine,<br />
Thy seed it was that sprang within my womb,<br />
Thine, and none other&mdash;traitor born and liar,<br />
False-faced, false-tongued&mdash;the fire of hell consume<br />
Me, thee, and him for ever!</p>

<p class="poetry">Thy sire? my lord? the flower of men?<br />
How?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">For thy tongue was tipped but now with
fire&mdash;<br />
With fire of hell&mdash;against him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Now, and then,<br />
Are twain; thou knowest not women, how their tongue<br />
Takes fire, and straight learns patience: Guendolen<br />
Is there no more than crownless woman, wrung<br />
At heart with anguish, and in utterance mad<br />
As even the meanest whom a snake hath stung<br />
So near the heart that all the pulse it had<br />
Grows palpitating poison.&nbsp; Wilt thou know<br />
Whence?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Could I heal it, then mine own were glad.</p>

<p class="poetry">What think&rsquo;st thou were the bitterest
wrong, the woe<br />
Least bearable by woman, worst of all<br />
That man might lay upon her?&nbsp; Nay, thou art slow:<br />
Speak: though thou speak but folly.&nbsp; Silent?&nbsp; Call<br
/>
To mind whatso thou hast ever heard of ill<br />
Most monstrous, that should turn to fire and gall<br />
The milk and blood of maid or mother&mdash;still<br />
Thou shalt not find, I think, what he hath done&mdash;<br />
What I endure, and die not.&nbsp; For my will<br />
It is that holds me yet alive, O son,<br />
Till all my wrong be wroken, here to keep<br />
Fast watch, a living soul before the sun,<br />
Anhungered and athirst for night and sleep,<br />
That will not slake the ravin of her thirst<br />
Nor quench her fire of hunger, till she reap<br />
The harvest loved of all men, last as first&mdash;<br />
Vengeance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">What wrong is this he hath done thee?&nbsp;
Words<br />
Are edgeless weapons: live we blest or curst,<br />
No jot the more of evil or good engirds<br />
The life with bitterest curses compassed round<br />
Or girt about with blessing.&nbsp; Hinds and herds<br />
Wage threats and brawl and wrangle: wind and sound<br />
Suffice their souls for vengeance: we require<br />
Deeds, and till place for these and time be found<br />
Silence.&nbsp; What bids thee bid me slay my sire?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I praise the gods that gave me thee: thine
heart<br />
Is none of his, no changeling&rsquo;s in desire,<br />
No coward&rsquo;s as who begat thee: mine thou art<br />
All, and mine only.&nbsp; Lend me now thine ear:<br />
Thou knowest&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">What anguish holds thy lips apart<br />

What thou to speak art bound not?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">How my lord,<br />
Our lord, thy sire&mdash;the king whose throne is here<br />
Imperial&mdash;smote and drove the wolf-like horde<br />
That raged against us from the raging east,<br />
And how their chief sank in the unsounded ford<br />
He thought to traverse, till the floods increased<br />
Against him, and he perished: and Locrine<br />
Found in his camp for sovereign spoil to feast<br />
The sense of power with lustier joy than wine<br />
A woman&mdash;Dost thou mock me?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">MADAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And a fair<br />
Woman, if all men lie not, mother mine&mdash;<br />
I have heard so much.&nbsp; And then?</p>

<p class="poetry">Thou dost not dare<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">I know not what should make thee mad<br />
Though this and worse, howbeit it irk thee, were.<br />
Art thou discrowned, dethroned, disrobed, unclad<br />
Of empire? art thou powerless, bloodless, old?<br />
This were some hurt: but now&mdash;thou shouldst be glad<br />
To take this chance upon thee, and to hold<br />
So large a lordly happiness in hand<br />
As when my father&rsquo;s and thy lord&rsquo;s is cold<br />
Shall leave in thine the sway of all this land.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Nay&mdash;I stand<br />
A man thy son before thee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GUENDOLEN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And a bold<br />
Man: is thine heart flesh, or a burning brand<br />
Lit to burn up and turn for thee to gold<br />
The kingship of thy sire?</p>

<p class="poetry">Why, blessed or banned,<br />
We thrive alike&mdash;thou knowest it&mdash;why, but now<br />
I said so,&mdash;scarce the glass has dropped one sand&mdash;<br

And thou didst smile on me&mdash;and all thy brow<br />
Smiled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Thou dost love then, thou, thy mother
yet&mdash;<br />
Me, dost thou love a little?&nbsp; None but thou<br />
There is to love me; for the gods forget&mdash;<br />
Nor shall one hear of me a prayer again;<br />
Yea, none of all whose thrones in heaven are set<br />
Shall hear, nor one of all the sons of men.</p>

<p class="poetry">I know not.&nbsp; Speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Have I kept silence all this while?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">What then?<br />
What boots it though thy word, thine eye, thy cheek,<br />
Seem all one fire together, if that fire<br />
Sink, and thy face change, and thine heart wax weak,<br />
To hear what deed should slake thy sore desire<br />
And satiate thee with healing?&nbsp; This alone&mdash;<br />
Except thine heart be softer toward my sire<br />
Still than a maid&rsquo;s who hears a wood-dove moan<br />
And weeps for pity&mdash;this should comfort thee:<br />
His death.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">And sight of Madan on his throne?</p>

This?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Nay, I lust not after empire so<br />
That for mine own hand I should haply care<br />
To take this deed upon it: but the blow,<br />
Thou sayest, that speeds my father forth of life,<br />
Speeds too my mother forth of living woe<br />
That till he dies may die not.&nbsp; If his wife<br />
Set in his son&rsquo;s right hand the sword to slay&mdash;<br />
No poison brewed of hell, no treasonous knife&mdash;<br />
The sword that walks and shines and smites by day,<br />
Not on his hand who takes the sword shall cleave<br />
The blood that clings on hers who gives it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Yea&mdash;<br />

<p class="poetry">Let that be nought<br />
Of all thy care: do thou but trust&mdash;believe<br />
Thy son&rsquo;s right hand no feebler than thy thought,<br />
If that be strong to smite&mdash;and thou shalt see<br />
Vengeance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">I will.&nbsp; But were thy musters brought<br

Crowned, and lift up thine eyes against the sun<br />
As one so pure in heart, so clean of hand,<br />
So loyal and so royal, none might cast<br />
A word against thee burning like a brand,<br />
A sound that withers honour, and makes fast<br />
The bondage of a recreant soul to shame&mdash;<br />

The brand across his brow that reddens thine?<br />
How shouldst thou dare&mdash;how dream&mdash;to let him live?<br

Is he not loyal? art not thou Locrine?<br />
What less than death for guerdon shouldst thou give<br />
My son who hath done thee service?&nbsp; Me thou hast

Blossom?&nbsp; What love, what reverence, what regard,<br />

Art thou not pure as honour&rsquo;s perfect heart&mdash;<br />
Not treason-cankered like my lord Locrine,<br />
Whose likeness shows thee fairer than thou art<br />

Thy voice makes all my brain a wheel of fire.<br />
Man, what have I to do with pride of power?<br />
Such pride perchance it was that moved my sire<br />

His brother&rsquo;s son, the brother&rsquo;s born above<br />
Him as above me thou, the crown and flower<br />
Of Britain, gentler-hearted than the dove<br />

How he whose wrath was rained as hail or snow<br />
On Troy&rsquo;s adulterous towers, when treacherous flame<br />
Devoured them, and our fathers&rsquo; roofs lay low,<br />
And all their praise was turned to fire and shame&mdash;<br />
All-righteous God, who herds the stars of heaven<br />
As sheep within his sheepfold&mdash;God, whose name<br />
Compels the wandering clouds to service, given<br />
As surely as even the sun&rsquo;s is&mdash;loves or hates<br />
Treason?&nbsp; He loved our sires: were they forgiven?<br />
Their walls upreared of gods, their sevenfold gates,<br />
Might these keep out his justice?&nbsp; What art thou<br />
To make thy will more strong and sure than fate&rsquo;s?<br />
Thy fate am I, that falls upon thee now.<br />
Wilt thou not slay me yet&mdash;and slay thy son?<br />

Conceived or bred in brain or heart of mine.<br />
Ye have levied wars against me, and compelled<br />
My will unwilling and my power withheld<br />

Against me: thine is each man&rsquo;s heart and hand<br />
That burns and strikes in all this battle raised<br />
To serve and slake thy vengeance.&nbsp; With my son<br />
I plead not, seeing his praise in arms dispraised<br />
For ever, and his deeds of truth undone<br />
By patricidal treason.&nbsp; But with thee<br />
Peace would I have, if peace again may be<br />
Between us.&nbsp; Blood by wrath unnatural shed<br />
Or spent in civic battle burns the land<br />
Whereon it falls like fire, and brands as red<br />
The conqueror&rsquo;s forehead as the warrior&rsquo;s hand.<br />
I pray thee, spare this people: reign in peace<br />
With separate honours in a several state:<br />
As love that was hath ceased, let hatred cease:<br />
Let not our personal cause be made the fate<br />
That damns to death men innocent, and turns<br />
The joy of life to darkness.&nbsp; Thine alone<br />
Is all this war: to slake the flame that burns<br />
Thus high should crown thee royal, and enthrone<br />
Thy praise in all men&rsquo;s memories.&nbsp; If thou wilt,<br />

Made me by forceful marriage-rites his wife.<br />
Then sailed they toward the white and flower-sweet strand<br />
Whose free folk follow on thy father&rsquo;s hand,<br />
And warred against him, slaying his brother: and he<br />
Hurled all their force back hurtling toward the sea,<br />
And slew my lord their king; but me he gave<br />
Grace, and received not as a wandering slave,<br />
But one whom seeing he loved for pity: why<br />
Should else a sad strange woman such as I<br />
Find in his fair sight favour? and for me<br />
He built the bower wherein I bare him thee,<br />
And whence but now he hath brought us westward, here<br />
To abide the extreme of utmost hope or fear.<br />
And come what end may ever, death or life,<br />
I live or die, if truth be truth, his wife;<br />

Though night grow strong, hath any part in him.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
